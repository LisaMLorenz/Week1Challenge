# Week1Challenge
## Improving accessibility of starter code HTML and CSS

### Description
I want to improve the accessibility of the given starter code to learn how to optimize websites for search engines. But also to improve them for persons with disabilities. I am working with a community group who currently have a website that is not very accessible visually. I'm not sure how the code looks like but in future I'd like to help with this, too. So this exercise will be very useful. The website is agile (maintained by a group of people) and needs to be concise and clear.

The challenge solves communication problems as accessible code is easier to fix and easier to improve and adjust.
